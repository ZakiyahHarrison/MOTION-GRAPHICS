                <h1>What PlantBox is About</h1>
                <h3>I started PlantBox back in 
                    2011 because I love houseplants and I love to write. 
                    Sharing knowledge about plants brings me so much joy, 
                    and I’m thrilled to share with you. At PlantBox, 
                    you’ll find practical tips, tools, and advice that will 
                    help you find success with your plants, no matter your situation. 
                    On the blog, I cover everything from common myths to best practices 
                    that help you nurture and grow healthy, thriving houseplants.
